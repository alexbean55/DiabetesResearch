# Topics_Project

There are three folders that help maintain our project: 

  1. code: This is where we will house all of our code that helps understand how we worked with the data for our analysis.
  2. data: This will house all our data. We will place all our data related work here such as our cleaned data, processed data.
  3. doc: Here we will maintain all our documeantation related to the project.
